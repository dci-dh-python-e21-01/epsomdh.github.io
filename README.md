Github allows you to serve web pages out of your repository. Read up on Github pages.
Then with the GIT repo that you started for your individual project last time, create a GitHub Pages site with a static home page. This will be used as the home page of the app, where we can put the login (when we have it). Write an HTML file with the title of the app and some enticing image (unsplash?). Possibly adding a menu with some basic options (assets, customers?) and create some basic HTML files for those pages, sharing the same style and menu.
